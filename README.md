## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

All the requirements and dependandies are specified in the pyproject.toml, please consult that when setting up your envrionment to properly run this project.

The easiest way to install any package is by running:

```sh
pip install [package_name]
```
If any package needs to be updated, run:

```sh
pip update [package_name]
```

### Usage

#### Cookiecutter template

We reccomend use of the Cookiecutter template for new installations of the project. After installing Cookiecutter, all you need to do is to run the following command:

```sh
cookiecutter gh:wustl-data/cropdusters_PR2
```

You will get an interactive prompt where you'll specify relevant options for your project (or the default value will be used). 
*NOTE* you will require properly setup permissions for the wustl-data organization in order to install using cookiecutter. The number of dependancies has been kept light to ensure an easy installation using pip or the package manager of your choice is a simple task.
